/**
 * Spine region — bones. What you're built around.
 *
 * Reads identity rows that weren't migrated to compass (section NOT LIKE
 * 'core.values.%'). Prose output, code-driven, no LLM.
 *
 * Verbs (R1a):
 *   - spine_read   — read the spine, grouped by section family
 *   - spine_amend  — write, or (Gate B, Mind Reshape 2) soft-archive an
 *                    identity row. mind_identity is retired from the MCP
 *                    surface as of this gate — this is the only door onto
 *                    the identity table now.
 *
 * Section families surfaced from the identity table:
 *   core.identity, core.essence, milestones, texture, fears,
 *   relationships, voice, etc. Heuristic: group by first dotted segment.
 *
 * Removal is SOFT (archived_at = NOW()), never a hard DELETE — identity rows
 * are spine, and a deliberate act on them gets provenance, not erasure. This
 * replaces mind_identity{action:'delete'}'s hard DELETE (retired same gate —
 * see migrations/postgres/0014_identity_archive.sql).
