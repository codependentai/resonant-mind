/**
 * handleMindGraph — graph-shape introspection. Polymorphic by `view`:
 *
 *   - sparse        — entities with ≥4 active observations and ≤1 relation.
 *                     The actionable list for relation work. (default)
 *   - disconnected  — entities with 0 relations. Some are legit standalone,
 *                     others are crying to be tied in.
 *   - hubs          — top-N entities by relation count.
 *   - empty         — entities with 0 active observations (named but unspoken).
 *   - connections   — for a named entity, show its full relation neighborhood.
 *
 * The engine under regions/network.ts's `graph_walk` verb (Gate A, Mind
 * Reshape 2) — a straight pass-through, no wrapping logic added.
